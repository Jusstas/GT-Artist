# GT-Artist

This project is for EDUCATION and ENTERTAINMENT purposes only so we do not seeking any profit from it.
Also, this is for helping Growtopia players to make pixel art in Growtopia game or even to look how any picture
looks like if it would be made from Growtopia blocks.

This project is unfinished and can be unstable.
Also feel free to open new issues and give some feedback.
